Procedures I used to identify errors:
1) I first opened and inspected all the files after pulling them into my local dev environment
2) I enabled debugging on my locahost and tried to run the site.
3) After receiving the first general coldfusion error, I opened the JASON file and threw it into a JSON validator to identify any errors
4) After fixing the JSON error, I inspected the index file and was able to fix the obvious errors (wrong attributes, missing closing cfif's, etc). I also formatted the code with indents for easier readability.
5) From there I utilized the Coldfusion debugging to identify and fix the remaining errors.

Errors Found:
1) Missing comma in the JSON file
2) The JSON contained in the cfhhtp.filecontent variable needed to be deserialized
3) The hidden form element "qCheck" needed to be uncommented
4) The variable "Match" needed to be defined and set
5) The cfloop that determines if the correct answer was submitted had the wrong attribute of "index" instead of "item"
6) The same cfloop had the array incorrectly referenced as "Animals" instead of "Animals.Animals"
7) There was a missing "</cfif>" in the loop that set the variable "Match"

* I also left comments in the Index.cfm file detailing where and what changes I made.


Enhancements:
When working through this project, it caught me a few times when I would submit an answer after I had already submitted one previously and I couldn't tell if I actually submitted the form or not because the "Incorrect"
image would remain. I added code that would hide the incorrect or correct image, if you had previously submitted an answer, when you select a different option in the dropdown. I know it wasn't required but I found it helpful 
to let me know that the form was working correctly. 

I left comments in the code in the Index.cfm file detailing what code I added for this "enhancement" and where I added it.
